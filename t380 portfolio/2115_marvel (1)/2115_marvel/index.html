<h3>Storyline</h3>
<p>Xiao Xiang is a teenage girl who has travelled to Singapore in order to further her studies. One day, Xiao Xiang suddenly received a call from her family, informing that Xiao Xiang’s sister, Wei Wen has died of a car accident back in her hometown. 
Hearing this, Xiao Xiang breaks down, grieving from the fact that she would never see her sister alive again. </p>
<p> Xiao Xiang and Wei Wen were very close back when Xiao Xiang was still in Thailand. They were inseparable, wherever one goes, the other one would follow. They spend most of their time together, studying and playing. Xiao Xiang is determined to see Wei Wen one last time. However, when Xiao Xiang digs out all the money she has, she realises that she does not have enough. Growing up from a lower-average income tier family, her parents had made ends meet and had save up for a long time just so they could send Xiao Xiang to Singapore.</p> 
					  <p><b>She knew that it was impossible for her to see her sister one last time.</b></p>
<p>Thinking about Wei Wen reminded of the note that she had written for her before she left for Singapore. She flips open the book and re-reads the note that Wei Wen has written for her. This added to the pain and sadness that Xiao Xiang had felt. She broke down, tears dripping down one by one onto the book. </p>
	
<p>Xiao Xiang runs out of the house, crying in despair. Xiao Xiang collapses onto the ground and memories of the times she had spent with Xiao Xiang came flooding to her mind again.</p>
<p>Flashforward towards night time, Xiao Xiang accidentally falls asleep on the sofa while she was looking through the photos that she have taken with Wei Wen. In her dream, Wei Wen puts her shoulder around Xiao Xiang, as if she was comforting Xiao Xiang. She reassures Xiao Xiang that everything would be alright and tells her to stay strong even though she is not around anymore.</p>
<p>However, a dream is just a dream. We see the back views of Xiao Xiang and Wei Wen, which signifies that her reunion with Wei Wen is far out of reach.</p>

	  <h4>Background Information</h4>
	 <p> A low-key music singer, named Pluto whose main genre is R&B, which works with a charity organisation. With that the music album aims to be the “light” towards the less fortunate as the proceeds earned from the album will be donated to charity.</p>
 <h4>Current Information</h4>
	  <p>Adults may prefer slower songs rather than upbeat songs, which may attract them to listen to the R&B genre.  After a long day of work, adults may feel very stressed and tired, which some may turn to music to destress. In addition, there is not a lot artists in Singapore whose main genre is RNB. This makes my music unique from other mainstream artists in Singapore.  For the design aspect, the raindrops represents the hardships faced by adults, while the light bulb represents the comfort the listeners will feel when listening to my music. It is to encourage them not to give up and no matter how hard it may seem right now, they will be able to overcome it.</p>
	 <h4>Objective</h4>
	  <p>I hope that my music will be able to bring comfort to people during difficult times .The slow-paced and quiet music of the r&b genre reflects the state of the minds of the adults after a long day of work. Lyrics of the song will be accompanied by the beats of the different instruments, which will be able to evoke emotions when the audience is listening to the song.</p>

		   <h4>Logo Rationale</h4>
		   <p>I had to design a logo for an Interior design themed magazine. For the magazine's name, I had decided to use the name, "Cosy". For the rationale behind the logo design, I had replaced the letter 'O' with an eye symbol. The eye symbol signifies 'Eye of Cosy', which meant that the magazine serves to publish different designs that are not just stylish, but also comfortable.</p>
		   <h4>Target Audience</h4>
		   <p>The target audience for the magazine would be adults aged from 25 to 38 because they are more likely to have a stable income and would want to find a new place to live in. They are also at a stage whereby they would likely be married or in a relationship.
To create a magazine cover that would attract this specific target audience, I have decided to keep it simple for the cover with minimal imagery used and fonts that gives off a more serious look. 
I have also created catchphrases such as "Time To Shiok" and "HDB Building, New Style" as seen from the magazine cover which resonates with the local audience.</p>
		   <h4>Analysis</h4>
		   <p>Since the magazine is targeted towards the local audience, I have analysed the current situation of Singaporeans' living environments.
In Singapore, the majority of the population lives in affordable, HDB buildings rather than high-end ones. When people go through interior related magazines, they would most likely prefer to see designs and styles that well-suited for HDB room layouts and architecture.Thus, I have chosen the "wooden" theme for the magazines content feature. To match the theme, I have also selected relevant interior and furniture images that fits the theme of the magazine.</p>
